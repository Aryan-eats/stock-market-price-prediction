# Stock Market Prediction

This project demonstrates a basic approach to predicting stock market prices using data analytics and machine learning techniques in Python. The goal is to explore historical stock data, perform feature engineering, and build predictive models to forecast future stock prices.


## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building using a variety of machine learning and statistical models
- Model evaluation and visualization

## Models Used
This project explores and compares multiple models for stock price prediction, including:

- **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **SARIMA** (Seasonal ARIMA)
- **VAR** (Vector AutoRegression)
- **GARCH** (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **SVR** (Support Vector Regression)
- **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory neural network)
- **BiLSTM** (Bidirectional LSTM)
- **GRU** (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- **Transformer** (Neural Network)
- **Hybrid ARIMA + LSTM**
- **CNN + LSTM** (Convolutional Neural Network + LSTM)

Each model is implemented and evaluated to compare their performance on stock price forecasting tasks.

## How to Use
1. Open the `StockMarketPrediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Follow the notebook cells to load data, analyze, and build models.
3. Modify the code to experiment with different models or datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn (and/or tensorflow/keras for deep learning)

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
